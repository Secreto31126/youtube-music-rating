See the song's popularity right next to the name!

The extension's settings are super customizable:
- You can pick which scale use to calculate the ratings
- You can pick which emoji or character use to show the results
- It also supports using a personal Youtube v3 API key (under advanced settings).

Last, as a small detail, you can hover over the ratings to see the number of listens each song has.

Original idea comes from the now missed Google Play Music store.

Known bugs:
- Going back in your history feed doesn't re-add the stats
- If a playlist contains over forty-ish elements, Youtube Music might not render all the songs at once, and the extension can't add those ratings (it's just a visual bug, the ones that worked as expected will still be mathematically correct)
